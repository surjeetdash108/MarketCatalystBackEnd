# MarketCatalyst — Market Intelligence Terminal

A subscription-based active-investor research platform that consolidates earnings, analyst actions, market movers, screening, insider/institutional flows, macro, and portfolio tools into a single dark-themed terminal. Built with Next.js 16 App Router (static export), Firebase Auth + Firestore, and Redux Toolkit.

15 of 18 screens now read at least some live data, additively merged onto the original mock UI (nothing was deleted to make room for it) — see `Doc/screen-data-sources.md` for the accurate, per-screen breakdown of what's real vs. still illustrative, and why. Options Chain's main bid/ask/IV/greeks/OI table stays simulated (Polygon's options snapshot is confirmed 403 on the current plan; would need an upgrade or a Tradier key), and Recaps remains fully static (blocked on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + a new job).

Recent additions (2026-07-08/09): full US ticker universe (~10,000+ tickers, price-only) wired to the Cmd+K search bar; Screener's RS Rating now computed from real OHLCV history instead of not existing at all; news upgraded to Polygon-primary (adds sentiment/reasoning/keywords) with Finnhub as automatic fallback; Portfolio's computed totals (`totalValue`/`dayPL`/`dayPLPct`) are now materialized into Firestore alongside the existing holdings CRUD, so something outside the browser can read portfolio value without recomputing it; a missing Firestore composite index on `ohlcv_bars` (`ticker`+`barDate`, needed by RS Rating and the Stock Detail chart) was found and deployed via a new `firestore.indexes.json`.

Ops tooling (2026-07-09, backend-only — not part of the MarketCatalyst app itself): every sync job now declares which Firestore collection(s) it writes and its cron schedule once, at registration (`backend/src/common/sync-registry.service.ts`); `sync_meta/{jobName}` persists this alongside every run result, and `GET /sync/jobs` additionally computes each job's next scheduled fire time on the fly (via the same `cron` library `@nestjs/schedule` uses internally, so it can't drift from what actually fires). A new `POST /sync/run-all` triggers every job sequentially for manual testing. `backendUI/index.html` (a static ops dashboard, `npx serve -l 4200 backendUI`) surfaces all of this — collections affected, interval, next run — plus a confirm-gated "Run all now" button.

Changes (2026-07-12):
- **Vendor migration to Polygon** — `dividends` (`/v3/reference/dividends`), `ipos` (`/vX/reference/ipos`), `sectors` (SPDR sector-ETF proxies), `market-indices` (ETF-proxy daily aggs), and `company profile` are now **Polygon-primary** with the previous vendor (FMP/Finnhub) kept as automatic fallback; each doc carries a `source` field recording which vendor served the run. **P/E is now computed from Polygon `/vX/reference/financials` (TTM diluted EPS)**, closing the gap that Polygon's ticker-reference endpoint has no ratios. Adapter routing lives in `backend/src/adapters/adapters.module.ts` and is env-var driven (`COMPANY_PROFILE_SOURCE`, `MOVERS_SOURCE`, `MOVER_ENRICHMENT_SOURCE`). Still NOT on Polygon (no product exists): earnings calendar + analyst consensus (FMP; Polygon 404s), peers + dividend yield (null on Polygon-served docs), macro (FRED), SEC filings (EDGAR).
- **sync_meta last-success / last-failure tracking** — `sync_meta/{jobName}` now persists `lastSuccessAt`/`lastSuccessCount` and `lastFailedAt` in separate fields (written only on that outcome, via Firestore merge), so one outcome never erases the other; `/sync/jobs` and the ops dashboard show "last ran OK" and "last failed" side by side. The dashboard also distinguishes Firestore-unreachable (`metaError`) from a genuine "never run".
- **Stock Detail candles fixed** — `useOhlcvBars` queried `orderBy('barDate','asc')`, which no deployed composite index served (only `ticker ASC, barDate DESC` exists), so every query errored and fell back to synthetic candles; it now queries DESC and reverses in memory. Live candles work for backfilled tickers on 3M/6M/1Y.
- **Live market-status indicator** in the shell header (Open / Pre-Market / After Hours / Closed), computed from real ET time + a US market-holiday list (`app/iq/market-status.ts`).
- **Computed indicator/score jobs (no vendor, no key, bounded storage)** — new jobs derive proprietary metrics from data already synced and upsert them onto `companies/{ticker}` (latest-snapshot): `technical-indicators` (RSI-14, MACD, RVOL from `ohlcv_bars`), `tech-rating` (1-99 composite momentum/trend/RSI + stock rank within sector), `fundamentals-growth` (YoY revenue/EPS growth + gross margin from Polygon `/vX/reference/financials`), and `fear-greed` (a CNN-style 0-100 index → `market_sentiment/fear_greed` from SPY momentum, market breadth, VIX, and SPY-vs-TLT safe-haven). All math validated against Polygon's own indicator API / 10-K figures. Wired into the UI: Stock Detail RSI/MACD + in-sector rank, Screener Tech Rating/RVOL/growth/margin columns+filters, Movers RVOL, Dashboard Fear & Greed gauge — each falling back to the prior seeded value until its job runs.
- **Multi-source news aggregation** — `AggregatingNewsAdapter` (`NEWS_SOURCE=aggregate`, now default) fetches Polygon + Finnhub in parallel and merges/de-dupes per ticker, instead of primary-or-fallback; each article keeps its `source`. (Alpha Vantage / Mediastack keys are stored but not wired — their free tiers, 25/day and ~3/day, are too small for the per-ticker job; they belong on a separate low-cadence market-news job.)
- **Ticker search by company name** — `ticker-universe.job` now also writes `nameLower` (case-insensitive) and `searchTokens` (name words + ticker) onto `tickers/{ticker}`; `useTickerSearch` runs three parallel queries (ticker prefix + name prefix + token) and merges. Requires a ticker-universe re-run to backfill the fields. Firestore can't do mid-word/alias search ("google" → "Alphabet Inc."); the shell's curated list does substring matching for the top names.
- **Firestore purging guidance** — the unbounded time-series (`ohlcv_bars` #1, then `news`, `*_history`, SEC data) should use **native TTL policies** (`expireAt` field per collection: `ohlcv_bars` = barDate+~400d, `news` = publishedAt+~90d). All new compute jobs write **bounded** snapshots, adding nothing to growth. The one-time backfill write bursts need Firestore on **Blaze** (Spark's 20k-writes/day cap is what surfaced the `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors).

Reliability & hardening (2026-07-12):
- **Crash isolation** — frontend gains Next.js error boundaries (`app/error.tsx` route-level, `app/global-error.tsx` root-level): a component error shows a recoverable fallback instead of a white screen, and the rest of the app keeps working. Backend `main.ts` gains process-level `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException` handlers so a single failing cron/sync job logs and the API keeps serving (never tears the process down), plus `enableShutdownHooks()` for graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT.
- **Proper logging** — backend `console.log` replaced with the Nest `Logger` (tagged `[Bootstrap]`/`[Process]`, stack traces on errors).
- **Error monitoring (Sentry)** — `@sentry/browser` (frontend, inited in `app/sentry-init.tsx`) and `@sentry/node` (backend, inited in `main.ts`), wired into the error boundaries + process handlers. **DSN-gated: a safe no-op until `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` / `SENTRY_DSN` are set**, then monitoring turns on with no further code. `tracesSampleRate: 0` (errors only, negligible overhead).
- **Dead code removed** — unused `app/dashboard/{sidebar,back-button,sign-out-button,user-avatar}.tsx` (0 imports; `auth-guard`/`menu-items` kept).
- **Unimplemented buttons wired** — Analyst "My names"/"PT >15% move" filters, Screener "Save screen" (persists filters to localStorage), Settings "Delete account" (Firebase `deleteUser` behind a typed confirmation). Payment/AI/transcript buttons deliberately left (blocked on Stripe/Claude/data — not faked).
- **Forgot-password fix** — no longer leaks account existence: an unknown email shows the same neutral "if an account exists…" message as a real one (was showing a nonsensical "Email or password is incorrect"), and the redundant `window.alert` was removed. *Verified live.*
- **Profile image control** — the raw file input is now a styled **Upload/Change image button** (hidden native input), and the "Stored as profile_image" hint string was removed.
- **Dev-server note** — the recurring Turbopack `FATAL /shot-helper/page` panic is caused by the screenshot tooling injecting/removing a transient route, leaving orphaned `.next` output; `rm -rf .next` + restart clears it. It does not affect production (static export) or normal Turbopack dev.

## Backend (`backend/`)

A separate NestJS service, not part of this Next.js app, syncs vendor data (Polygon, FMP, Finnhub, FRED, SEC EDGAR) into Firestore on cron schedules — this app reads the results via the Firestore client SDK, same as any other collection, and never calls a vendor directly or holds a vendor key. See `backend/README.md` for how to run it, `Doc/openapi.yaml` for the full documented data contract, and `Doc/schema.sql` for the equivalent relational schema if this ever migrates off Firestore.

### Data flow (verified 2026-07-09)

```
Vendor APIs (Polygon, FMP, Finnhub, FRED, SEC EDGAR)
        │  17 NestJS cron jobs, each on its own periodic interval
        │  (daily/weekly/every-30-min — see backend/README.md's job table)
        ▼
   Cloud Firestore  (backend/src/common/firebase-admin.provider.ts — Admin SDK, server-only)
        │  onSnapshot() real-time listeners (app/iq/hooks/useCollection.ts, useOhlcvBars.ts)
        ▼
   Next.js app (this repo) — every live screen element
```

Confirmed end-to-end, not assumed:
- Every one of the 17 sync jobs in `backend/src/sync/*.job.ts` has a real `@Cron(...)` schedule — none are one-off or manually-triggered-only.
- Zero vendor API domains or vendor API keys are referenced anywhere in `app/` (grepped for Polygon/FMP/Finnhub/FRED/SEC EDGAR URLs and every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*_API_KEY` var name — no matches).
- `.env.local` (frontend env) had 3 live, populated `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vendor keys left over from before the backend migration, unused by any code — blanked out 2026-07-08 as a security cleanup (was gitignored, never committed, so not a git-history leak, but no reason for a live credential to sit there once the frontend stopped calling vendors directly).

Where the requirement isn't yet fully met: not every screen element has a live source wired up yet (some genuinely have none — AI content needs Claude, some are intentionally curated/editorial, not vendor data at all). See `Doc/screen-data-sources.md` for the exhaustive, per-element breakdown of what's live vs. still illustrative, and exactly why for each one.

## Mobile Responsive

The web app is fully responsive at `≤767px` (mobile) and `≤900px` (auth pages):

- **Shell**: Grid collapses to single-column. Rail becomes a fixed slide-in drawer triggered by a hamburger button (`.mob-ham`). The scrim (`.mob-nav-scrim`) is placed inside `.app` to share the same CSS stacking context as the rail (z-200), preventing it from blocking nav taps.
- **Drawers & Copilot**: Drawers become bottom-sheets (`border-radius` on top corners). Copilot FAB becomes an icon-only 48px circle.
- **Options page**: Expiry tabs scroll horizontally (`flex-wrap: nowrap; overflow-x: auto`). Stock header meta wraps below price at narrow widths.
- **Auth pages**: Two-panel `AuthLayout` collapses at `≤900px` (stacks vertically) and at `≤600px` the marketing panel is hidden — only the form card is shown, full-width.

## Navigation

The shell (`IQShell`) wraps every authenticated page with a left sidebar of 14 workspaces grouped into three categories:

| Group | Workspace |
|---|---|
| Intelligence | Dashboard, Earnings, Market Movers, Market Heatmap, Analyst Actions, Screener, IPOs, Stock Detail, Options, Insider & Institutional |
| My Money | Portfolio Pulse, Watchlist, Themes |
| Context | Commentary, Recaps, Macro & VIX |

---

## Design System

Defined in `app/iq.css` via CSS custom properties on `:root`:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--brand` | `#7C6CF5` | Primary purple |
| `--brand-2` | `#9B8BFF` | Lighter purple accent |
| `--ai` | `#34E2F0` | AI teal / gradient endpoint |
| `--up` | `#2FE6A6` | Positive / gain |
| `--down` | `#FF5470` | Negative / loss |
| `--bg` | `#080B11` | App background |
| `--surface-0/1/2/3` | Dark surfaces | Card backgrounds |

Key component classes: `.pill`, `.pill.up/.down/.ai/.hold/.dn/.amc`, `.card`, `.col-N`, `.tr-badge`, `.ai-block`, `.wmn`, `.filt`, `.dd`

**Mobile classes** (desktop-hidden by default, activated in `@media (max-width: 767px)`): `.mob-ham`, `.mob-brand`, `.mob-rail-head`, `.mob-nav-close`, `.mob-nav-scrim`, `.mob-open` (on `.rail`)

---

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server (Turbopack)
npm run build        # static export to /out
firebase deploy      # deploy to Firebase Hosting
```

Runs on Next.js 16.2.9 with `output: 'export'`. All 24 routes are pre-rendered as static HTML.
